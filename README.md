My answer for the NBA Hackathon Application in 2017.

Hello! Please find my attempt at the bonus question for the NBA Hackathon application.

I have created a program with over 1200 lines of code to simulate the entire NBA season and output when each team is eliminated from playoff contention.

I have coded up until Rule (2), as outlined in the tiebreaker document. It would be difficult to test (and take a lot of funky code) a season where all the tiebreakers are even
until a certain point. The Miami Heat are the last team to be eliminated, with tiebreaker (1).

My code will output the text to a file, out.txt. Just in case it doesn't work, you'll see the out.txt I got when I ran the program.

Simply double click the jar file to run.

Also found is the excel spreadsheet provided in the application. I have removed one row at the top of the games for formatting purposes.

All code is my own. I have utilized the Apache POI library in order to read the Excel spreadsheet into my document.

Thank you!
